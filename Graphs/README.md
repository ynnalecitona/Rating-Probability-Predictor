# k-Nearest Neighbors

## kNN Probability Distribution
With k = 5, the probability distribution between 1-maxRatings is showing to be a uniform distribution.
In the InstEval data set he probability of a student rating an instructor 1-5 is equal in probability, for
most cases.

# kNN Mean Rating Probabilities
In terms of accuracy, when comparing the results from the test data to the validation data, the accuracy of
the model seems to be high.  

# Classification and Regression Trees
The CART method seems to yield a positive and negative skewed distribution. The model shows that the
probability a user would rate an item is either really high or really low.
