# k-Nearest Neighbors

## kNN Probability Distribution
With k = 5, the probability distribution between 1-maxRatings is showing to be a uniform distribution.
In the InstEval data set he probability of a student rating an instructor 1-5 is equal in
probability, for most cases.

However, if you view the distribution for larger k values, you can see that the distributions no
longer become uniform.

## kNN Mean Rating Probabilities
In terms of accuracy, when comparing the results from the test data to the validation data, the
accuracy of the model seems to be high.  

## Classification and Regression Trees Probability Distribution
The CART method seems to yield a positive and negative skewed distribution. The model shows that the
probability a user would rate an item is either really high or really low.

## Logit Probability Distribution
Other than the outliers of the data, you can see that Logit almost seems to be normally
distributed.

## Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Probability distribution
The probability distribution for NMF shows that a user has a higher tendency to rate really low or
really high if you account for the outliers.
